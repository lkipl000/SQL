This repository contains a SQL project that aims to demonstrate my skills in working with databases and SQL queries. In this project, I have used SQL to create a database schema, populate it with data, and write queries to extract meaningful insights.
### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have access to a SQL database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, I am using MSSSQL in this project .You can either create a new database (in this project I am using a database named LEO)  and run the SQL queries provided in this project or use an existing database.
### Files

The repository contains the following files:

schema.sql: This file contains the SQL commands to create the database schema, including the tables and their relationships.

data.sql: This file contains the SQL commands to populate the database with data.

queries.sql: This file contains the SQL queries that I have written to extract insights from the database.

README.md: This file that you are reading now.

Database Schema
The database schema used in this project consists of several tables that are related to each other. The schema is designed to store information about customers, orders, products, and sales. The relationships between the tables are established using foreign keys.

Data
The data used in this project is generated using random data generators. It is meant to be a representation of a hypothetical e-commerce store. The data includes information about customers, orders, products, and sales.

Queries
The SQL queries provided in this project demonstrate my ability to write complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from a database. The queries cover a variety of topics such as customer segmentation, product analysis, and sales trends.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates my skills in working with SQL databases and writing SQL queries. I hope that it serves as a useful resource for anyone who wants to learn more about SQL or is looking for examples of SQL projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
